      <p>Abstract:</p>
      <div class="bibo:abstract">
        <p>Amyloid fibrils are a common component in many debilitating
    human neurological diseases such as Alzheimer&apos;s (AD),
    Parkinson&apos;s, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and in animal diseases such
    as BSE. The role of fibrillar ?? proteins in AD has stimulated
    interest in the kinetics of ?? fibril formation. Kinetic models
    that include reaction pathways and rate parameters for the
    various stages of the process can be helpful towards
    understanding the dynamics on a molecular level. Based upon
    experimental data, we have developed a mathematical model for
    the reaction pathways and determined rate parameters for
    peptide secondary structural conversion and aggregation during
    the entire fibrillogenesis process from random coil to mature
    fibrils, including the molecular species that accelerate the
    conversions. The model and the rate parameters include
    different molecular structural stages in the nucleation and
    polymerization processes and the numerical solutions yield
    graphs of concentrations of different molecular species versus
    time that are in close agreement with experimental results. The
    model also allows for the calculation of the time-dependent
    increase in aggregate size. The calculated results agree well
    with experimental results, and allow differences in
    experimental conditions to be included in the calculations. The
    specific steps of the model and the rate constants that are
    determined by fitting to experimental data provide insight on
    the molecular species involved in the fibril formation
    process.</p>
